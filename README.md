scenejs-engine
=======================

SceneJS.Engine is a modular and extensible engine built on top of SceneJS V3.0, the WebGL-based 3D rendering engine.

Briefly, each module within the engine

    * manages the lifecycle and state of some portion of the scene graph
    * defines actions to expose its functionality, which can be executed via JSON RPC
    * fires events
    * can be dynamically loaded and unloaded

Modules are then orchestrated by JavaScript game scripts, which fire their actions and handle their events.

It's super simple, scales up quickly, and is rather addictive!
